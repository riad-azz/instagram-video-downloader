# Gram Grabberz (Instagram Video Downloader)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project is an educational demonstration of building a web application to
download Instagram videos using Next.js. The primary goal is to explore modern
web development techniques, including server-side rendering/components, API
interaction (potentially via Next.js API routes), state management, form
handling, and building a clean UI with Shadcn/ui.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Downloading
videos from Instagram may violate their Terms of Service. Please respect
copyright laws and the platform's policies. Use this tool responsibly and only
for content you have the right to download.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Download Instagram Videos:** Input an Instagram video URL to fetch and
  download the video file. (Note: Functionality depends on the backend
  implementation, which isn't detailed here but is a core part of the learning
  experience).
- **Modern Frontend Stack:** Built with the latest Next.js (App Router).
- **Clean UI:** User interface crafted using [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  components and styled with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Responsive Layout:** Ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience
  across different screen sizes.
- **Type-Safe:** Written entirely in TypeScript.
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Robust input handling using React Hook Form
  and Zod for schema validation.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Efficient data fetching and state management with
  TanStack Query (React Query).
- **Theming:** Supports light and dark mode using `next-themes`.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Setup for multi-language support using
  `next-intl`.
- **User Feedback:** Uses `sonner` for toast notifications.
- **Optimized Development:** Utilizes Next.js Turbopack (`--turbopack`) for
  faster development builds.

## üìö Educational Goals

This project serves as a learning resource for understanding:

- **Next.js Fundamentals:** App Router, Server Components, Client Components,
  API Routes (if implemented for backend logic), SSR/SSG concepts.
- **UI Development:** Building composable and accessible UI components with
  Shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **State Management:** Managing server state, caching, and background updates
  with TanStack Query.
- **Form Management:** Implementing complex forms with validation using React
  Hook Form and Zod.
- **API Integration:** Fetching data from external sources or custom backend
  endpoints. (The specifics of interacting with Instagram are a key learning
  challenge).
- **TypeScript:** Leveraging static typing in a full-stack React framework.
- **Modern Styling:** Using Tailwind CSS v4 features and utilities like `clsx`
  and `tailwind-merge`.
- **Internationalization:** Setting up and managing translations with
  `next-intl`.
- **Project Structure & Tooling:** Organizing a Next.js application, using
  ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riad-azz/instagram-video-downloader.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd instagram-video-downloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn install # or npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   - This project uses Turbopack for faster development builds.

   ```bash
   yarn dev # or npm run dev
   ```

   - The application should now be running on
     [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Build for production:**

   Ensures Locales are up to date, must be run every time you add/edit a locale
   file for production _(no need to run for development)_.

   ```bash
   yarn build:locales # or npm run build:locales
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn build # or npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the production server:**

   ```bash
   yarn start # or npm run start
   ```

## üí° Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Find the Instagram video you wish to download and copy its URL.
3. Paste the URL into the input field on the application's main page.
4. Click the "Download" button.
5. If successful, a download link or button for the video file should appear.

## üîê Accessing Private Content (Experimental & Optional)

To access private Instagram videos that require authentication, this application can use Instagram session cookies provided via environment variables. This method directly uses your browser's session information to make authenticated requests.

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your local environment (e.g., in a `.env` file if your setup supports it, or directly in your shell) before running the application:

-   `INSTAGRAM_SESSION_ID`: The `sessionid` cookie.
-   `INSTAGRAM_CSRF_TOKEN`: The `csrftoken` cookie.
-   `INSTAGRAM_DS_USER_ID`: The `ds_user_id` cookie.
-   `INSTAGRAM_IG_DID`: The `ig_did` cookie.

Optionally, you might also need:

-   `INSTAGRAM_RUR`: The `rur` cookie.
-   `INSTAGRAM_MID`: The `mid` cookie.

### How to Obtain Cookies

You can typically obtain these cookie values from your web browser's developer tools:

1.  Log in to your Instagram account in your web browser.
2.  Open the developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
3.  Go to the "Application" (in Chrome/Edge) or "Storage" (in Firefox) tab.
4.  Look for "Cookies" under the storage section and find the cookies for `https://www.instagram.com`.
5.  Copy the respective values for `sessionid`, `csrftoken`, `ds_user_id`, `ig_did`, etc.

**Note:** These cookies are sensitive and grant access to your Instagram account. Handle them securely and do not share them. They may also expire or change, requiring you to update them.
